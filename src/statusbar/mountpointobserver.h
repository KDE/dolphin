/**
 * A MountPointObserver can be used to determine the free space on a mount
 * point. It will then check the free space periodically, and emit the signal
 * spaceInfoChanged() if the return value of spaceInfo() has changed.
 *
 * Since multiple users which watch paths on the same mount point can share
 * a MountPointObserver, it is not possible to create a MountPointObserver
 * manually. Instead, the function observerForPath(QString&) should be called,
 * which returns either an existing or a newly created MountPointObserver for
 * the mount point where the path is mounted. observerForPath(QString&) looks
 * for a suitable MountPointObserver in an internal cache and creates new
 * MountPointObservers and adds them to the cache if necessary.
 *
 * Reference counting is used to keep track of the number of users, and to
 * decide when the object can be deleted. A user of this class should call
 * the method ref() when it starts using it, and deref() when it does not need
 * the MountPointObserver any more.
 *
 * The object will not be deleted immediately if the reference count reaches
 * zero. The object will only be destroyed when the next periodic update of
 * the free space information happens, and the reference count is still zero.
 * This approach makes it possible to re-use the object if a new user requests
 * the free space for the same mount point before the next update.
