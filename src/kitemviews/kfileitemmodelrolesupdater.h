/**
 * @brief Resolves expensive roles asynchronously and applies them to the KFileItemModel.
 *
 * KFileItemModel only resolves roles that are inexpensive like e.g. the file name or
 * the permissions. Creating previews or determining the MIME-type can be quite expensive
 * and KFileItemModelRolesUpdater takes care to update such roles asynchronously.
 *
 * To prevent a huge CPU and I/O load, these roles are not updated for all
 * items, but only for the visible items, some items around the visible area,
 * and the items on the first and last pages of the view. This is a compromise
 * that aims to minimize the risk that the user sees items with unknown icons
 * in the view when scrolling or pressing Home or End.
 *
 * Determining the roles is done in several phases:
 *
 * 1.   If the sort role is "slow", it is determined for all items. If this
 *      cannot be finished synchronously in 200 ms, the remaining items are
 *      handled asynchronously by \a resolveNextSortRole().
 *
 * 2.   The function startUpdating(), which is called if either the sort role
 *      has been successfully determined for all items, or items are inserted
 *      in the view, or the visible items might have changed because items
 *      were removed or moved, tries to determine the icons for all visible
 *      items synchronously for 200 ms. Then:
 *
 *      (a) If previews are disabled, icons and all other roles are determined
 *          asynchronously for the interesting items. This is done by the
 *          function \a resolveNextPendingRoles().
 *
 *      (b) If previews are enabled, a \a KIO::PreviewJob is started that loads
 *          the previews for the interesting items. At the same time, the icons
 *          for these items are determined asynchronously as fast as possible
 *          by \a resolveNextPendingRoles(). This minimizes the risk that the
 *          user sees "unknown" icons when scrolling before the previews have
 *          arrived.
 *
 * 3.   Finally, the entire process is repeated for any items that might have
 *      changed in the mean time.
